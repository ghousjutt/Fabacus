# Getting Started with npm

This project was created with [npm init -y](https://www.npmjs.com). Npm init simply makes package.json, you can make it manually if you know the structure or already have one you can copy and paste, it doesn't create a dist folder or any other folder. You need a package.json file to place your packages in, else how would npm know what packages your project needs.

### `npm install`

First run the command in project dir [npm run install](https://www.npmjs.com).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode on localhost:3000
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `Redis`

Project has redis node package, it installed when you run command [npm install] but you have to install it's server locally to run it on localhost by running command [redis-server](https://redis.io/docs/getting-started/installation/install-redis-on-mac-os/)
